# Minesweeper-AI
AI that can play Minesweeper.

Knowledge-based agents make decisions by considering their knowledge base, and making inferences based on that knowledge.

One way we could represent an AIâ€™s knowledge about a Minesweeper game is by making each cell a propositional variable that is true if the cell contains a mine, and false otherwise.
This gives us a propositional logic sentence to solve :)
